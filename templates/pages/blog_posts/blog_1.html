<p><b>Finally finished!!!!!!</b> I've been working on redesigning this site for ages, but now I have it at a state where I feel like it's finally complete. I think the blog portion was the most challenging part to finish, because I couldn't think of a good way to implement it on a static site. On an earlier version of this site, my blog was just one long page with all of the articles grouped together. Hopefully this format serves a bit better!</p>
<p>I'm feeling a bit lazy right now (spent a lot of time finishing this site), so here's an introduction that I wrote a while back:</p>

<div class="my-4 px-3 text-body-emphasis" style="border-left: 2px solid">
  <p>My name is John (o/ hi!). I'm currently a <s>sophomore (almost junior)</s> Computer Science student at Stevens Institute of Technology (in Hoboken, NJ). I was born and raised in a small suburb in northern New Jersey. Computers have always been a hobby for me; while my friends would ask for new shoes and such for birthdays, I would ask for new tech and gadgets to entertain myself with. My first true experience with computer science was during my freshman year of high school, and I've loved it ever since! Unfortunately, my school's computer science offerings were extremely lacking (perhaps that's a topic for another blog post!), but ever since starting at Stevens in 2021, I've been slowly and surely expanding my skillset.</p>
</div>

<p>I wrote this in the fall of 2022, a bit under a year ago, and since then, I've had a significant burst of motivation. Using some skills that I've learned from my coursework, and from my own self-study, I've started/released a couple of significant projects. Most notably, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6450715380">I've released an app on the App Store!</a> App development in Swift was completely self-taught, so I'm extremely happy to have my work published!</p>

<p>That was the most significant event since the last time I blogged. In future posts I hope to go into more detail of my app project, and all of my future projects as well.</p>

<p>- John</p>
